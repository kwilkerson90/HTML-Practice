      <p>No, not the Drake song. But we're getting actual practice. This part of the exercise has a few objectives. It's called
          "Nesting Tags", so let's start there. Per the Code Academy discussion board, "nested elements are children of their parent 
          container." You might not be able to tell off rip, but the paragraph and heading tags are nested within the div tag. Get it?
          Got it? Good.

        <b>Moving on...</b> Let's practice making lists.
        <h1>It's Tuesday. Tell me why you're vibing high today.</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>I practiced gratitude today</li>
          <li>I had <sub>really</sub> good cup of coffee today</li>
          <li>I'm learning something new, and that makes me feel <span style="color:teal">good</span></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What are some things you learned from the guest speakers?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Being is good problem-solver is crucial</li>
            <li>You want to be a T-shaped person, rather than an I-shaped person</li>
            <li>Being collaborative/a team player is hella important</li>
        </ul>
